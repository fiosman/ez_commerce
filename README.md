EzCommerce is an e-commerce web application that offers swift shopping experience.

Development by Fares Osman. This project is not meant to "clone" any well known applications. This is a demo site to showcase my programming knowledge, primarily in backend and frontend web development.

Development period was from September 6, 2020 - December 20, 2020. I worked on this project part time, while being committed to a full time job in a different industry.

## Main Features

### Admin Dashboard

#### Add, Update Product Forms
