EzCommerce is an e-commerce web application that offers swift shopping experience.

Development by Fares Osman. This project is not meant to "clone" any well known applications. This is a demo site to showcase my programming knowledge, primarily in backend and frontend web development.

Development period was from September 6, 2020 - December 20, 2020. I worked on this project part time, while being committed to a full time job in a different industry.

## Live Link

You can visit the latest deployed version of the application [here](https://ez-ecomm.herokuapp.com/#/).

## Main Features

### Admin Dashboard

Users have the ability to upload products via an interactive form through the admin dash. User friendly error messages are also integrated in case of an invalid form field input.
